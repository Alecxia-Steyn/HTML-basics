# HTML-basics
Learning HTML and sharing what I have learned along the way
D1: I learned there are two main structures in HTML, <body> and <head>
D2: I learned more about headings. There are 6 levels of headings and <h1> is the largest and one page should not contain more than one of this specific heading. Everything else will act as sub-headings (<h2> till <h6>).  I also learned there are two types of tags: closed tags (e.g. <h1></h1>) and empty tags (e.g. <img>)
D3: I learned about images. <img> and that the "src" attribute is used to specify the URL and the "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image
D4: I learned that there are two lists. <ol> is an ordered list, ordered by numbers, letters or roman numerals. <ul> is an unordered list, so it can be ordered by bullet-points, blocks or nothing at all
