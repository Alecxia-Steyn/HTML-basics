# HTML-basics
Learning HTML and sharing what I have learned along the way
D1: I learned there are two main structures in HTML, <body> and <head>
D2: I learned more about headings. There are 6 levels of headings and <h1> is the largest and one page should not contain more than one of this specific heading. Everything else will act as sub-headings (<h2> till <h6>).  I also learned there are two types of tags: closed tags (e.g. <h1></h1>) and empty tags (e.g. <img>)
D3: I learned about images. <img> and that the "src" attribute is used to specify the URL and the "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image
D4: I learned that there are two lists. <ol> is an ordered list, ordered by numbers, letters or roman numerals. <ul> is an unordered list, so it can be ordered by bullet-points, blocks or nothing at all
D5: I learned about links. A link is written between <a></a>. A href attribute specifies the link address. A local link is more simple since it refers to a section in the same website. Univisited links: blue and underlined; visited links: purple and underlined; active links: red and underlined. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document and there are 4 elements: _blank: new window/tab; _self: (usually the default) same window/tab; _parent: parent frame; _top: full body window. <iframe> Opens the linked document in a named frame. Image links: code the image after the link to embed the link within the image. To add a clickable link title use the title attribute after coding the link attribute
D6: I learned each document that will be using html must start with <!DOCTYPE html>. After each <head> you must start with <meta charset="utf-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial scale=1"> so that no matter the device your website gets opened on, it will appear to scale. Using <title> under <head> will set the title of your webpage. <br> Is used for line breaks and if you want bigger breaks, add more <br>. <b> for bold; <i> for italic; <u> for underline; <em> for emphasize; <strong> for strong. Each of these are closed tags. <b> and <strong> are essentially the same, and <i> and <em> are also the same. <hr> Creates a horizontal line, but must be used in a single row by itself. <a> means anchor: to anchor one website to another. href means hypertext reference. URL means universal resource locator. Using the border tag within the img tag or table tag will create a border around your image or table and you can set how many pixels wide it may be. When writing a list, items listed follow a <li> (closed) tag. Lists can be created within lists. If you put one html tag within another that is referred to as nesting, like a russian doll. The outer element is the parent element and the inner element is the child element. Always indent the child element so it is distinguishable. Within tables: cellpadding creates extra space in each cell between the text and the border, and cellspacing creates space between cells. In tables, make sure to have the same amount of columns in each row of the table. <tr>: table row; <th>: table header; <td>: table data -all closed tags. <th colspan="x"> adjusts the column span by the number put in x; <td rowspan="x"> adjusts the row by the number put in x. If you want to make a blank cell: <th></th> as is, without any content
