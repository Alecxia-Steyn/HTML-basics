# HTML-basics
Learning HTML and sharing what I have learned along the way
D1: I learned there are two main structures in HTML, <body> and <head>
D2: I learned more about headings. There are 6 levels of headings and <h1> is the largest and one page should not contain more than one of this specific heading. Everything else will act as sub-headings (<h2> till <h6>).  I also learned there are two types of tags: closed tags (e.g. <h1></h1>) and empty tags (e.g. <img>)
